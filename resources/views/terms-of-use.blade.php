Any description of the Services provided by Internship Ghana is not a representation that the Services are working or will always work in that manner, as Internship Ghana is continuously updating the Services, and these updates may not always be reflected in the Terms of Use.

                    <p>
                        The Services may offer features and services that are available to you via your mobile device. These features and services may include, without limitation, the ability to upload content to the Services, receive messages from the Services, download applications to your mobile phone or access features from the Services (collectively, the "Mobile Features"). We may charge for Mobile Features and these charges will be disclosed prior to completion of registration for the Mobile Feature. Also, standard messaging, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier. Carrier fees and charges will appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Mobile Features and certain Mobile Features may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you change or terminate your mobile account, you agree to promptly update your Internship Ghana account information so that any messages or notices from Internship Ghana regarding the Services are sent to you and not to the person who is assigned your old number.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        For any of our mobile apps, you agree that the third-party store or platform through which our apps are available (including, without limitation, the Apple App Store) is not liable to you in connection with our apps. If you use any ISBN scan feature of the Services, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the scanned code before relying on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding any other provision within these Terms of Use, the following additional terms are applicable to those using any app governed by these Terms on an Apple iOS device (“App”): You understand that these Terms of Use are between you and Internship Ghana only, and not Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), and that Internship Ghana (or any third-party developer that may own and operate the App) are responsible for the App and the content thereof.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Email and Text Message Notifications</h3>
                    <p>
                        Notifications or receipts from Internship Ghana will be delivered to you by email at the address you provided to Internship Ghana when you created your account or as later updated. You may also opt to receive text message reminders from Internship Ghana as a courtesy to you. Please review our text message mobile disclosures, which are incorporated into the Terms of Use.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Payments and Payment Processing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Validation: Internship Ghana may require users of the Services to provide a valid method of payment (e.g., credit or debit card, PayPal account, etc.) tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Internship Ghana) or upon ordering products or services. If a method of payment is required, you are responsible for ensuring that a valid method of payment is associated with your Internship Ghana account at all times (either the original method of payment or a replacement). To confirm your method of payment is valid, Internship Ghana may initiate a "pending" charge on the account. This charge will not be confirmed and, therefore, you will not be charged, and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your financial institution for additional information). Please be aware that this pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the payment information for your account or place an order that cannot be processed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Third-Party Links, Content and Applications</h3>
                    <p>
                        There may be links from the Services, or from communications you receive from the Services to third-party websites or online features. The Services also may include third-party content that we do not control, maintain, or endorse.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Bibliography and Citation Services</h3>

                    <p>
                        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Internship Ghana Parties from and against any and all loss, liability, damages, judgments, claims, demands, costs, investigations, settlements, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or directly or indirectly relating to (a) your User Content; (b) your breach or anticipatory breach of these Terms of Use; (c) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; (d) information or material transmitted through your computer, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy or other right of any person or defames any person; (e) any misrepresentation made by you; or (f) the Internship Ghana Parties' use of your information or User Content as permitted under these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, or any other written agreement between you and Internship Ghana.

These indemnity obligations shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Internship Ghana.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a dispute arises between you and Internship Ghana, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Internship Ghana agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between us arising out of or related to the Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, of the Services or your use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be finally settled by individual binding arbitration in accordance with this “Dispute Resolution” section, and not in a court of law. This “Dispute Resolution” section shall also be referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement." Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court, if the claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
                    </p>

                   <p>
                        All rentals remain the property of Internship Ghana, or third-party partners for physical text books, even while the item is in your possession. You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Internship Ghana or third-party partners, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle. If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option. In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your method of payment is approved for purchase value. If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we or our third-party partners provide the book to the shipping company. Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.

                        As current and former students, the Internship Ghana team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates. That being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward. Copying solutions or posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on the Services.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared to be wholly or partially void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision is severed to the extent that it is void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable and all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. The failure of Internship Ghana to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Non-performance of either party, except for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party. This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Internship Ghana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Entire Agreement
                        The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the entire agreement between you and Internship Ghana regarding the Services. The Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative of Internship Ghana and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or communication with us, regardless of whether Internship Ghana signs them or fails to object to them. This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Internship Ghana.
