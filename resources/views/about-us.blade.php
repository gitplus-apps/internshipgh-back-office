                <h5>About</h5>
                <p>
                    We created this platform as a result of the overwhelming requests by students to undertake their internship with us. We researched and found that there are so many students who are unable to secure places for their internship. Likewise, there are so many organizations seeking students to undertake some internship with them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two parties – employers and the interns – benefit mutually from this relationship. Interns get to learn on the job and have hands-on practice on the theories and models they have learnt. Employers also benefit from the contributions these interns make to alleviate them from the huge pending tasks.

                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is where Internship Ghana comes in. Our platform is dedicated to both companies and prospective interns. The companies have the opportunity to select students that meet their requirements and students also have the opportunity to intern with their desired organizations.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Our processes are very simply and we continue to improve the platform and also add more services.
                </p>
